In the aws_vpc resource block, you specify the instance tenancy with the option of choosing between "default", "dedicated", and "host".

Default
Instances launched in a VPC with instance_tenancy set to "default" will be on shared hardware by default. 
This means that the physical server hosting your instance may also host instances from other AWS customers.

Dedicated
With "dedicated" tenancy, all instances launched in the VPC will run on dedicated physical servers. 
This ensures that the server is exclusively reserved for your use, without sharing physical resources with other customers.

Host
Though not directly specified as an option for instance_tenancy in a VPC, AWS also offers the concept of launching instances on a Dedicated Host. 
A Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
